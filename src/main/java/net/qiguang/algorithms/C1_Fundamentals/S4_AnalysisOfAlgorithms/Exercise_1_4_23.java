 * 1.4.23 Binary search for a fraction.
 * Devise a method that uses a logarithmic number of queries of the form:
 *
 * Is the number less than x?
 *
 * to Ô¨Ånd a rational number p/q such that 0 < p < q < N.
 *
 * Hint: Two fractions with denominators less than N cannot differ by more than 1/(N^2).
 *
 * Note: Hint is incorrect. Opposite is true.
 * Note2: Question is unclear... p/q is always a rational number. What is it asking us to find?
