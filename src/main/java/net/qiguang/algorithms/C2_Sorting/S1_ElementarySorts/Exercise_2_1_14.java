 * 2.1.14 Dequeue sort.
 * Explain how you would sort a deck of cards, with the restriction that the only allowed operations are
 * to look at the values of the top two cards, to exchange the top two cards, and to move the top card to
 * the bottom of the deck.
 *
 * Answer:
 * Put the smaller of the two cards on top, then move the top card to the bottom of the deck.
 * Continue until you can go one full cycle through the deck where the first of the top two cards is always
 * the smallest.
