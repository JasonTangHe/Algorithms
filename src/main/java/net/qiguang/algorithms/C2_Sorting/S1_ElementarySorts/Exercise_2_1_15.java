 * 2.1.15 Expensive exchange.
 * A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of rearranging a number of large crates
 * in order of the time they are to be shipped out. Thus, the cost of compares is very low
 * (just look at the labels) relative to the cost of exchanges (move the crates).  The warehouse
 * is nearly fullâ€”there is extra space sufficient to hold any one of the crates, but not two.
 * What sorting method should the clerk use?
 *
 * Answer:
 * Selection sort
